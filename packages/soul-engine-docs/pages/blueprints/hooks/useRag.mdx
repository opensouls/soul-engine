# useRag

The `useRag` hook makes integrating RAG into your soul incredibly simple. The hook returns a `withRagContext` function that transforms the working memory into a shape that pulls relevant context.

```typescript filename="speaksWithRag.ts" {6,8}
import { useActions, useRag } from "soul-engine"

const speaksWithRag: MentalProcess = async ({ step: initialStep }) => {
  const { speak, log  } = useActions()
  const { withRagContext } = useRag()
  // pull in the RAG context to the working memory
  const step = await withRagContext(initialStep)
  // generate some new speech having the RAG context
  const { stream, nextStep } = await step.next(
    externalDialog(standardMessage),
    { stream: true, model: "quality" }
  );
  speak(stream);

  return nextStep
}
```

Data for RAG is specified in your soul's [Blueprint](/blueprints).
```
/rag               ----> files to be chunked and stored for rag context
    [context1].md
     ...
```

These files are automatically synced, chunked, embedded and made available to the `useRag()` hook.

Currently, we only support chunking of text-based files (and only smart chunking of `.md` files), but we plan to support additional types. Let us know if your use case requires more file types.
