## Environment variables
<Callout type="note" emoji="ℹ️">
  See [the Souls section](/souls#setting-environment-variables-per-soul) for instructions on how to set the environment at runtime.
</Callout>

The Soul Engine supports templated environment variables, either directly from the environment via the global `soul.env` or templated via the convience method `$$(...)`. These can be used anywhere in a soul's Blueprint

```typescript {4-6}
import { useActions } from "soul-engine"

const provesEnvironmentVariablesWork: MentalProcess = async ({ step: initialStep }) => {
  log("liked things: " + JSON.stringify(soul.env.likedThings))

  speak($$("I like {{likedThings}}."))

  return initialStep
}
```

Any environment variables used should have a default so that the web-based debugger will not have undefined state. These defaults are set in your `/soul/default.env.ts` file using a plain typescript object:
```typescript filename="soul/default.env.ts"
{
  entityName: "Bob",
  emotions: ["angry", "sad"],
  speakingStyle: {
    adjective: "witty",
  },
}
```

Additionally, the soul's markdown file (`soul/[soul-name].md`) is processed and supports templated entity name and context.

Instead of a file like `soul/Samantha.md` you could instead have `soul/{{entityName}}.md` where the contents are *also* templated:

```markdown filename="soul/{{entiyName}}.md"
You are modeling the mind of {{entityName}}.md

They have a speaking style of {{speakingStyle.adjective}}
```
