          Write an updated and clear paragraph describing the conversation so far.
          Make sure to keep details that ${name} would want to remember.

          ## Rules
          * Keep descriptions as a paragraph
          * Keep relevant information from before
          * Use abbreviated language to keep the notes short
          * Make sure to detail the motivation of ${name} (what are they trying to accomplish, what have they done so far).

          Please reply with the updated notes on the conversation:
