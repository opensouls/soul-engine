> Working Memory for AI Souls

The OPEN SOULS `core` library provides developers with straightforward and powerful tools for guiding the cognitive processes of large language models (LLMs), making it simpler to craft more dynamic and compelling AI souls.

This open source library offers WorkingMemory and cognitiveSteps for managing context. Each cognitiveStep operates on WorkingMemory, treating every interaction as a distinct transformation. This method ensures a structured and coherent progression of context, allowing for a more predictable and streamlined way to navigate an AI souls thought process. The result is a more consistent and intuitive interaction flow.
