# Subprocesses

A set of `MentalProcess` functions can be launched to run continuously in the background following each run of the main-thread `MentalProcess` by placing them in the `subprocesses` directory of the sou. The behavior of `subprocesses` is the following:
- They operate on the `WorkingMemory`, identical to the main-threaded process
- Each subprocess runs in order of the `subprocesses` directory (alphabetical).
- Any new incoming `Perception` terminates execution of the entire `subprocesses` execution.

As an example, consider a `MentalProcess` that continuously learns about the user the soul is speaking with:

```typescript filename="subprocesses/learnsAboutTheUser.ts"
import { ChatMessageRoleEnum, createCognitiveStep, indentNicely, MentalProcess, useActions, useProcessMemory, WorkingMemory } from "@opensouls/engine";

// Write a custom cognitive function that will keep notes about a user
const userNotes = createCognitiveStep(() => {
  return {
    command: ({ soulName: name}: WorkingMemory) => {
      return {
        role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.System,
        content: indentNicely`
          Model the mind of ${name}.

          ## Description
          Write an updated and clear set of notes on the user that ${name} would want to remember.

          ## Rules
          * Keep descriptions as bullet points
          * Keep relevant bullet points from before
          * Use abbreviated language to keep the notes short
          * Do not write any notes about ${name}

          Please reply with the updated notes on the user:
        `,
      }
    },
    postProcess: async (_workingMemory, response: string) => {
      return [
        {
          role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.Assistant,
          content: response
        },   
        response
      ]
    }
  }
})

const learnsAboutTheUser: MentalProcess = async ({ workingMemory: initialStep }) => {
  const userModel = useProcessMemory("Unkown User")
  const { log } = useActions()

  let step = initialStep
  let finalStep = initialStep

  step = step.withMemory({
