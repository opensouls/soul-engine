# Adjusting a WorkingMemory

`WorkingMemory` is a container for [memories](working-memory#the-memory-interface) with functions for immutable transformation.

`WorkingMemory` instances are immutable. This means that once an instance is created, it cannot be modified. Instead of changing the existing instance, methods that alter the state of the `WorkingMemory` (such as `withMemory`, `map`, `filter`, etc.) return a new instance of `WorkingMemory` with the modifications applied. This approach helps ensure safety and predictability, especially in asynchronous environments.

`CognitiveStep`s are used to create new WorkingMemory instances using an LLM, and have their own documentation.

`WorkingMemory` provide a variety of methods to manipulate memories and return a new `WorkingMemory`.

* `withMemory(memory)` - adds a new [memory](working-memory#the-memory-interface) to the `WorkingMemory` and returns a new instance
* `slice(begin, end)` - returns a new `WorkingMemory` with memories sliced between the begin and end indices.
* `map(callback)` - applies a callback function to each [memory](working-memory#the-memory-interface), returning a new `WorkingMemory` with the results.
* `asyncMap(callback)` - Applies a provided asynchronous function to each [memory](working-memory#the-memory-interface), producing a new `WorkingMemory` instance with the results.
* `filter(callback)` - filters memories based on a callback function, returning a new `WorkingMemory` with the filtered results.
* `find(callback)` - returns the first [memory](working-memory#the-memory-interface) that satisfies the provided testing function, encapsulated in a new `WorkingMemory`.
* `concat(mem: WorkingMemory | Memory[])` - merges two instances of `WorkingMemory` into one, returning a new instance.
* `prepend(otherWorkingMemory)` - Prepends the memories of another `WorkingMemory` (or an array of [Memory](working-memory#the-memory-interface) objects) to the memories of the current `WorkingMemory` instance, returning a new instance.
* `withMonologue(content)` - Adds a [memory](working-memory#the-memory-interface) with the role of Assistant and the provided content to the `WorkingMemory`, returning a new instance.

## Constructor and Initialization Options

To create a new instance of `WorkingMemory`, you can use its constructor with the following options:

```ts
interface WorkingMemoryInitOptions {
  soulName: string;
  memories?: InputMemory[];
  processor?: ProcessorSpecification;
  postCloneTransformation?: (workingMemory: WorkingMemory) => WorkingMemory;
}
```

* `soulName`: A unique identifier for the soul (or context) the memory belongs to.
* `memories`: An optional array of `InputMemory` objects to initialize the working memory with.

Example:
```typescript
const workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({
  soulName: "ExampleSoul",
  memories: [{ role: "User", content: "Hello, world!" }],
});
```
