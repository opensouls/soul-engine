# Learning By Example

Here we will walk through progressively more complex systems built using [WorkingMemory](./working-memory) and [CognitiveSteps](./cognitive-step). The cognitive steps used are at the [bottom of this page](#cognitive-steps).

## Simple Example

Using WorkingMemory and cognitive steps can be thought of as building up a set of memories, and then performing functional, append-only manipulations on those memories. Here is a simple example that initializes a WorkingMemory with memories of being a helpful AI assistant and applies a cognitive step to process new messages.

```ts
import { WorkingMemory, ChatMessageRoleEnum, Memory } from "@opensouls/core";
import { externalDialog } from "./lib/cogntiveSteps.js";

// Initialize WorkingMemory with initial memories
let workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({
  soulName: "A Helpful Assistant",
  memories: [
    {
      role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.System,
      content: "You are modeling the mind of a helpful AI assistant",
    },
  ],
});

// Then, during an event loop, withReply(...) would be called with a memory of each new message:
async function withReply(workingMemory: WorkingMemory, newMessage: Memory): Promise<WorkingMemory> {
  // externalDialog is a cognitiveStep defined in another function.
  const [updatedMemory, response] = await externalDialog(workingMemory, newMessage);
  console.log("AI:", response);
  return updatedMemory;
}
```

## Chain of thought

Complex dialog agents require more thoughtful cognitive modeling than a direct reply. AI souls from the Soul Engine feels so uncanny because their feelings and internal cognitive processes are modeled. Here's a 3 step process that models the way a soul might formulate a message.

```ts
async function withIntrospectiveReply(workingMemory: WorkingMemory, newMessage: Memory): Promise<WorkingMemory> {
  // Add the new message to the working memory
  let updatedMemory = workingMemory.withMemory(newMessage);

  // Process the internal monologue about feelings towards the last message
  [updatedMemory] = await internalMonologue(updatedMemory, "How do they feel about the last message?");
  
  // Process further thoughts about the feelings and the last user message
  [updatedMemory] = await internalMonologue(updatedMemory, "Thinks about the feelings and the last user message");
  
  // Generate the external dialog based on the updated working memory
  const [finalMemory, response] = await externalDialog(updatedMemory, "Respond to Booto");
  
  console.log("Samantha:", response);
  return finalMemory;
}
```

## Decision making
Moving beyond a simple dialog agent, cognitive steps easily support decision making.

In this example, we tell an agentic detective to think through a set of case memories before making a decision on what action to take.

```ts
async function caseDecision(caseMemories: ChatMessage[]): Promise<string> {
  // Initialize WorkingMemory with the initial memory of being a detective
  let workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({
    soulName: "Detective",
    memories: [
      {
        role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.System,
        content: "You are modeling the mind of a detective who is currently figuring out a complicated case",
      },
    ],
  });

  // Add case memories to the WorkingMemory
  workingMemory = workingMemory.concat(caseMemories)

  // Process the analysis of the evidence
  [workingMemory] = await internalMonologue(workingMemory, "The detective analyzes the evidence");

  // Formulate a hypothesis based on the analysis
  [workingMemory] = await internalMonologue(workingMemory, "The detective makes a hypothesis based on the analysis");

  // Decide the next step based on the hypothesis
  const [finalMemory, decision] = await decision(
    workingMemory,
    {
      instructions: "Decides the next step based on the hypothesis",
      choices: ["interview suspect", "search crime scene", "check alibi"],
    }
  );

  return decision;
}
```

## Brainstorming

Similar to decision making which narrows effective context scope, brainstorming can expand scope. As opposed to choosing from a list of options, a new list of options is generated.

In this example, we ask a chef to consider a basket of ingredients, then brainstorm what dishes could be made.


```ts
async function makeDishSuggestions(ingredientsMemories: ChatMessage[]): Promise<string[]> {
  // Initialize WorkingMemory with the initial memory of being a chef
  let workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({
    soulName: "Chef",
    memories: [
      {
        role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.System,
        content: "You are modeling the mind of a chef who is preparing a meal.",
      },
    ],
  })

  // Add ingredients memories to the WorkingMemory
  workingMemory = workingMemory.concat(ingredientsMemories)

  // Consider the ingredients
  [workingMemory] = await internalMonologue(workingMemory, "The chef considers the ingredients");

  // Brainstorm meal ideas
  const [, mealIdeas] = await brainstorm(
    workingMemory,
    "Brainstorm meal ideas based on the ingredients",
  );

  return mealIdeas;
}
```

## Branching
Here's an example of a simplified internal monologue which makes a progressive sequence of branching decisions and while maintaining prior context.

```ts
import { WorkingMemory, ChatMessageRoleEnum } from "@opensouls/core";

const initialMemories = [
  {
    role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.System,
    content: "You are modeling the mind of a protagonist who is deciding on actions in a quest",
  },
];

let workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({
  soulName: "Protagonist",
  memories: initialMemories,
});

let quest;

// The protagonist considers the quests
[workingMemory, quest] = await decision(workingMemory, {
  instructions: "Protagonist considers the quests",
  choices: ["slay dragon", "find artifact"],
});

if (quest === "slay dragon") {
  // Branch 1: Slay the dragon
  [workingMemory, quest] = await decision(workingMemory, {
    instructions: "Protagonist decides how to prepare for the quest",
    choices: ["gather weapons", "train skills"],
  });

  if (quest === "gather weapons") {
    // implement gather tooling for character
  } else {
    // implement training tooling for character
  }
} else {
  // Branch 2: Find the artifact
  [workingMemory, quest] = await decision(workingMemory, {
    instructions: "Protagonist decides how to find the artifact",
    choices: ["search old records", "ask elders"],
  });

  if (quest === "search old records") {
    // search for clues about the artifact
  } else {
    // ask the elders about the artifact
  }
}

console.log(quest);
```

            Model the mind of ${name}.
    
            ## Instructions
            * DO NOT include actions (for example, do NOT add non-verbal items like *John Smiles* or *John Nods*, etc).
            * DO NOT include internal thoughts (for example, do NOT respond with John thought: "...").
            * If necessary, use all CAPS to emphasize certain words.
    
            ${instructionString}
    
            Please reply with the next utterance from ${name}. Use the format: ${name} ${verb}: "..."
