## ðŸ¤” What is this?

> The Soul Engine is currently in private alpha! [Join our mailing list](https://opensouls.beehiiv.com/subscribe) to be the first to hear about the next updates!

Soul Engine provides developers clean, simple, and extensible abstractions for directing the cognitive processes of large language models (LLMs), steamlining the creation of more effective and engaging AI souls.

This repo is the public, monorepo hosting our [open source core](./packages/core), our [command line tool](./packages/soul-engine-cli/).

AI Souls are agentic and embodied digital beings, one day comprising thousands of mental processes (managed by the Soul Engine). Unlike traditional chatbots, this code will give digital souls personality, drive, ego, and will.
