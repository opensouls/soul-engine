## 🤔 What is this?

**Open Souls** offers developers clean, simple, and extensible abstractions for directing the cognitive processes of large language models (LLMs), steamlining the creation of more effective and engaging AI souls.

This repo is the public, monorepo hosting our [open source core](./packages/core), our [command line tool](./packages/soul-engine-cli/), and code for interacting with the hosted [Soul Engine](https://docs.souls.chat).

## 💫 AI Souls

AI Souls are agentic and embodied digital beings, one day comprising thousands of mental processes (managed by the Soul Engine). Unlike traditional chatbots, this code will give digital souls personality, drive, ego, and will.

## 📖 Repo structure

- [`/packages/core`](./packages/core) contains the core, open source, library for creating AI souls.
- [`/packages/engine`](./packages/engine) contains the client side code for building and interacting with the [Soul Engine](https://docs.souls.chat)
- [`/packages/soul-engine-cli`](./packages/soul-engine-cli/) contains the command line interface (CLI) for creating and developing AI souls with the [Soul Engine](https://docs.souls.chat).
