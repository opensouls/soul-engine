Soul Engine provides developers clean, simple, and extensible abstractions for directing the cognitive processes of large language models (LLMs), steamlining the creation of more effective and engaging AI souls.

This repo contains the SDK for the Soul Engine.

## ðŸ’« AI Souls

AI Souls are agentic and embodied digital beings, one day comprising thousands of mental processes (managed by the Soul Engine). Unlike traditional chatbots, this code will give digital souls personality, drive, ego, and will.

- [`/packages/engine`](./packages/engine) contains the client side code for building and interacting with the Soul Engine.
