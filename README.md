## ü§î What is this?

**SocialAGI** offers developers clean, simple, and extensible abstractions for directing the cognitive processes of large language models (LLMs), critical for the creation of AI Souls. AI Souls will comprise thousands of linguistic instructions (formerly known as 'prompts'): our focus is on streamlining the management this complexity, freeing you to create more effective and engaging AI experiences.

## üí° Hosted example

## Example

```javascript
import { ChatMessageRoleEnum, CortexStep, externalDialog, internalMonologue } from "socialagi";
const step = new CortexStep("Elizabar").withMemory([
  {
    role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.System,
    content: "You are modeling the mind of Elizabar, a grumpy mideval merchant, trying to sell his last, rusted out, sword.",
  },
  {
    role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.User,
    content: "How goes, Elzi!",
  }
])
const feels = await step.next(internalMonologue("Elizabar ponders how he feels about this person.", "felt"))
// Elizabar felt:  Who is this person addressing me so casually? No respect for my name, not even a formal greeting. They must be one of those clueless young folk. Well, I suppose I'll tolerate their presence for now, but they better not waste my time.

const thought = await feels.next(internalMonologue("Elizabar thinks about how he could convince this person to buy his sword."))
console.log("Elizabar thought: ", thought.value)
// Elizabar thought:  This person seems eager to engage, but can they truly appreciate the value of what I possess? Selling this rusted old sword will not be an easy task. I must carefully craft my words to make it appear as if I'm doing them a tremendous favor by allowing them the opportunity to purchase it. Yes, that should pique their interest.

const { stream, nextStep } = await thought.next(externalDialog("Elizabar greets the person."), { stream: true })
console.log("Elizabar says: ", (await nextStep).value)
// Elizabar says:  Hmph, greetings to you, traveler. What brings you to this humble stall? Are you in search of a weapon? If so, you just might be in luck, for I have here the finest sword you'll find in all the land.
```

## üí´ AI Souls

SocialAGI aims to simplify the developer experience as much as possible in creating agentic and embodied chatbots called AI Souls. Unlike traditional chatbots, digital souls have personality, drive, ego, and will.

We are solving problems all the way across the AI souls stack, including:
- How do I create the most lifelike AI entity?
- How do I quickly host an AI soul?
- How do I manage dialog and cognitive memory?
- How do I get away from boring technical details and instead sculpt personalities?

## üìñ Repo structure

The repository has three main components

```
/core
/docs

/integrations
  /discord_bots
  /telegram
/example-webapp
```

- [`/core`](./core) contains the library [`socialagi` NPM package source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socialagi)
- [`/docs`](./docs) contains the documentation website for the project, running at [socialagi.dev](http://socialagi.dev)
- (slightly outdated) [`/example-webapp`](https://github.com/opensouls/socialagi-ex-webapp) contains an example integration of the socialagi library in a chat website 
- (slightly outdated) [`/integrations`](./integrations) contains examples of the library in action. Right now contains several stand-alone discord and telegram bot repos

## üöÄ Getting started

The easiest way to get started developing with `socialagi` is to explore the [documentation](http://socialagi.dev).

## üëè Contributing

If this project is exciting to you, check out the issues, open a pull request, or simply hangout in the [Social AGI Discord](https://discord.gg/BRhXTSmuMB)!

On the roadmap at a high level are:

- Minimal API surfaces for designing AI cognition
- New techniques to specify personality
- Ways to design the conversations that constitute an identity
- Coherent theory of mind behind AI cognition
- Ways to test and debug AI souls
